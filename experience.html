      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Mt. Healthy High School in 2014. After graduating I went on to study computer networking at the University of Akron, where I would complete two years of the program. I would then transfer to Stark State College, and continue studying computer networking for another year. </p>

      <h2>Work History</h2>
      <p>When I first arrived at college I worked at a fast food chain as an grill cook. I worked there for about two years before accepting a job as a technical support agent for a cable provider.</p> 
      
      <p>As I only worked as a technical support agent for six months, I learned so much and received a solid foundation into IT that I was able to accept a position as a computer hardware technican.</p> 
      
      <p>After a year I decied to move back to Cincinnati, where I accepted a job as a desktop support specialist for a big eyeglass firm, and continue to work there now.</p>
